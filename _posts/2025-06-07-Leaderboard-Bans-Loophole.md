### tldr
 -   The leaderboard ban (Flag64) is supposed to prevent banned users from appearing on leaderboards<br>
 - But due to how the system works, **the ban only hides players temporarily**, they will reappear.
 - Those reappearances then **generate fresh reports**, which are later used against the player as evidence of repeated misconduct.
 - When the issue was reported to MacDGuy, with evidence presented, he deleted posts of it happening.<br>

## Leaderboard Reappearances
In **April 2025**, **NixEmotions** raised a concern, a Chinese player named **SuSu** had cheated their way to the top of the **Trivia score** leaderboard - a position that typically takes players **years** to reach. <br>
After she highlighted this, the devs **removed SuSu’s Trivia score** by applying a leaderboard ban onto their account, implying they also agreed it was illegitimate.  [(^1)](https://steamcommunity.com/app/394690/eventcomments/604153951183464508?snr=1_2108_9__2107&ctp=8#c604153951183496049)

Weeks later Nix reported on SuSu again, this time SuSu achieved rank **#3** in Bowlings **Total Score**, and **Perfect Games.** <br>
Nix believed if the Trivia score was wiped due to suspected cheating, it's only reasonable that **all** of SuSu’s scores be **scrutinised**, if not removed entirely, to maintain the **integrity of the leaderboards** and respect the time and effort of legitimate players.

>The flag doesn't reset your score to zero, it just **temporarily** hides it.

Despite SuSu having been removed from the leaderboards numerous times now, Nix claims that they are once again rank 1. <br>
MacDGuy appeared, saying that he would look into it on Monday. Without any intervention by Mac due to the already implemented leaderboard ban, SuSu was automatically removed from the leaderboards for the 2nd known time.

It's now been **6 weeks** since the issue was first reported.<br>
GateTheCat joined the conversation showing a screenshot of SuSu yet again returning to rank **#1 in Trivia**. <br>
At this point, there's no question that **there's something wrong with the ban system**.

## Firsthand Experience In Leaderboard Bans

Back in **~2020**, I received the first leaderboard ban. <br>
Since then, I've reappeared on the leaderboards **hundreds of times**. The system hasn't worked for years. [(^3)](https://web.archive.org/web/20250601003906/https://forums.pixeltailgames.com/t/1-0-0-0-suspicious-possibly-cheated-high-scores-by-a-specific-player-on-leaderboards-still-present-on-other-leaderboards/53241) And I proved it with **before-and-after** screenshots of reaching rank **#1 Laser Tag**, despite being banned myself.
It was proof that leaderboard bans were not working.

><span style="color:grey"> Flag64 may be the worst flag you can receive, for the reason that PixelTails broken system enables repeat appearances on the leaderboard that inflates report counts, which then escalate into harsher bans like mutes, media restrictions, and server bans. </span>


## Leaderboard Loophole
I shared my firsthand experience with the system's failure as a reply to the on-going thread. I explained how players with leaderboard bans were receiving **additional reports** - a pattern clearly visible in this very thread in relation to SuSu.  <br> In my own case, I was reported multiple times in **March 2024** for **cheating** my way onto the Laser Tag leaderboards **overnight**. 

<div style="text-align:center;">

    <img src="https://i.imgur.com/V0utPz7.png" width="400" />
  </a>
</div>

Those same reports from March were cited in my ban appeal. PixelTail stated I was banned due to an **accumulation of recent reports**, describing my behaviour as **part of an ongoing trend**.<br>They also acknowledged that **one of the major reports was about exploits** - even though I’d been banned from the leaderboards 4 years earlier. Instead of questioning why a banned player was showing up at all, staff took those reports at face value.

  </a>
</div>

Each reappearance invites new reports, which are then **counted against your account**, regardless of whether any actual cheating occurred. When you finally get banned, MacDGuy cites these accumulated reports as justification. **All reports are tied to your account, valid or not.**

The devs didn't respond. <br>Instead, my post exposing this flaw - and the repeated reappearance of banned players - was **deleted by MacDGuy**. He then locked Nix’s thread and left behind a vague message implying _everything was under control_. <br>
 But nothing changed. **SuSu was rank #1 again that same day.**

## Exploits Should Not Be Shared Publicly
I created my own thread asking **why** my post had been removed.  [(^4)](https://web.archive.org/web/20250601074659/https://forums.pixeltailgames.com/t/moderation-impacting-mental-wellbeing/53401) <br>
I laid out the facts one more time, and attached the screenshot as proof.  I offered to demonstrate to MacDGuy in-game on how leaderboard bans currently fail to function.

He **edited my thread** instead. <br>
Deleting the attached proof, pretends in the *'deleted-post'* that I never reported the issue to the moderation team initially, then **accused me of 'sharing exploits.'** [(^5)](https://web.archive.org/web/20250601092822/https://forums.pixeltailgames.com/t/moderation-impacting-mental-wellbeing/53401)

## The Damage Done
False accusations from a lead developer don’t just disappear.<br>
Mac framed me as someone - "instructing others on how to exploit leaderboard bans". Assigning malicious intent where there was none, and then locked the thread to shut down any chance of defending myself.

To be clear: **I was not sharing exploits**.<br>I was exposing a broken system - one that has been silently failing for 5 years, dating back to **before the Arcade even existed**, when everyone was still gambling in the Casino. <br> Whether the deletion was out of embarrassment or an attempt to bury the truth, it's clear PixelTail wanted this off the record.



What Mac didn't anticipate was this: **I archived everything**. <br>When I brought the archived links to his attention, I was banned from the forum for Harassment.

## Appeal Process Loophole
Here’s the second loophole they won’t acknowledge:  
They _can’t_ delete a banned player’s old score.

That score - the one that got you banned in the first place - still exists, sitting in the database.
The only fix they’ve come up with is a cheap patch job: They’ve set the system to auto-refresh and remove flagged players from the leaderboard every cycle.
And that’s why leaderboard ban appeals can never succeed.

Because if they lift the ban, your same score reappears, showing everyone the system never actually worked.  
**Flag64 is permanent**, nobody has ever successfully appealed a leaderboard ban. 

PixelTail could rewrite the system to support leaderboard appeals, but that risks breaking achievements, milestones, or stat tracking. With only 6 active players out of 141 leaderboard bans, it’s not worth their effort to bother - and really, who's going to ever find out this information, **unless one of the 6 talks**.
<div style="text-align:center;">

</div>

PixelTail’s appeal process is nothing more than a PR stunt.
