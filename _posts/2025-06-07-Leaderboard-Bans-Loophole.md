## 1. How It Fails

A **leaderboard ban** (internally marked as _Flag64_) is supposed to prevent banned users from appearing on leaderboards.

But it doesn’t delete the player’s score. Instead, it tags them, and a background system periodically sweeps those flagged users off the boards. Until that sweep runs again, the banned player remains visible - on every leaderboard across the game, not just the one they were banned from. <br> Those reappearances then  **generate fresh reports**, which are later used against the player as evidence of repeated misconduct.

There’s no exploit, no hack, and no workaround involved.
The player has **zero control** over this reappearance. 

## 2. Reappearances Amplify Punishment
###  The Case of SuSu
In **April 2025**, **NixEmotions** raised a concern, a Chinese player named **SuSu** had cheated their way to the top of the **Trivia** leaderboard. The devs responded by applying a leaderboard ban and removing that specific score. 

<div style="text-align:left;">
  <img src="https://i.imgur.com/HSEbxPo.png" width="400"/>
</div>

<br>Weeks later, SuSu reappeared - this time ranking #3 in Bowling. The ban had been applied, yet the player’s scores kept returning. [(^1)](https://steamcommunity.com/app/394690/eventcomments/604153951183464508?snr=1_2108_9__2107&ctp=8#c604153951183496049) 

Nix believed if the Trivia score was wiped due to suspected cheating, it's only reasonable that **all** of SuSu’s scores be **scrutinised**, if not removed entirely, to maintain the **integrity of the leaderboards** and respect the time and effort of legitimate players. <br> SuSu's scores *were* removed, but the system allows reappearances onto the leaderboards within minutes after the server refresh.

Despite multiple reports and the ban still in place, **SuSu would later reclaim #1 in Trivia, again.**

It's now been **6 weeks** since the issue was first reported, and GateTheCat joined the conversation showing a screenshot of SuSu yet again returning to rank **#1 in Trivia**. <br> At this point, there's no question that **there's something wrong with the ban system**.  [(^2)](https://forums.pixeltailgames.com/t/1-0-0-0-suspicious-possibly-cheated-high-scores-by-a-specific-player-on-leaderboards-still-present-on-other-leaderboards/53241) 

SuSu's case isn't isolated - I've experienced the same issue firsthand.


###  My Own Case

In **March 2020**, I received *the* first leaderboard ban. <br> By 2024, I had reappeared on the leaderboards **hundreds of times,**  [(^3)](https://web.archive.org/web/20250601003906/https://forums.pixeltailgames.com/t/1-0-0-0-suspicious-possibly-cheated-high-scores-by-a-specific-player-on-leaderboards-still-present-on-other-leaderboards/53241) - including reappearing at #1 in Laser Tag, the same position I held before the ban. The system still allows banned users to gain new score and passively climb the leaderboards - or simply reappear where they once were. I proved it with **before-and-after** screenshots showing my banned account reappearing at rank **#1,** unchanged since 2020. <br> It was proof that leaderboard bans were not working.

><span style="color:grey"> Flag64 may be the worst flag you can receive, for the reason that PixelTails broken system enables repeat appearances on the leaderboard that inflates report counts, which then escalate into harsher bans like mutes, media restrictions, and server bans. </span>

The devs didn't respond. <br>Instead, my post exposing this flaw - and the repeated reappearance of banned players - was **deleted by MacDGuy**. He then locked Nix’s thread and left behind a vague message implying _everything was under control_. <br>
 But nothing changed. **SuSu was rank #1 again that same day.**

## 3. Leaderboard Loophole
Each reappearance triggers more reports on players with leaderboard bans - a pattern clearly visible with what's going on in Nix's thread.
PixelTail uses those additional new reports to justify further punishments like mutes and server bans - never questioning why a banned player was visible in the first place. 

In my own case, I was reported multiple times in **March 2024** for **cheating** my way onto the Laser Tag leaderboards **overnight**. 

<div style="text-align:center;">
  <a href="https://i.imgur.com/4zbAAeF.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">

  </a>
</div>

PixelTail cited these reports from **March 2024** in my ban appeal and stated I was banned due to an **accumulation of recent reports**, describing my behaviour as **part of an ongoing trend**. <br>They acknowledged that **one of the major reports was about exploits** - even though I’d been banned from the leaderboards 4 years earlier.

## 4. Censorship & Gaslighting
I sought to understand the reasoning for my posts removal, by laying out the facts one more time, attaching the screenshot as proof again. I offered to demonstrate to MacDGuy in-game on how leaderboard bans currently fail to function.  [(^4)](https://web.archive.org/web/20250601074659/https://forums.pixeltailgames.com/t/moderation-impacting-mental-wellbeing/53401) 

He **edited my thread** instead, deleting the attached proof and pretends in the *'deleted-post'* that I never reported the leaderboard issue to the moderation team initially. [(^5)](https://web.archive.org/web/20250601092822/https://forums.pixeltailgames.com/t/moderation-impacting-mental-wellbeing/53401)

</div>

When the broken system was exposed, MacDGuys response was **accusing me of spreading exploits** as justification for its removal. <br>  To be clear, I was not sharing exploits. I reported a system that had not worked as intended for the last 5 years, dating back to **before the Arcade even existed**, when everyone was still gambling in the Casino. <br>

When I later called him a **liar** for deleting proof and painting me in a false light on his platform, I was swiftly banned from the forum for “Harassment.” [(^6)](https://web.archive.org/web/20250601115047/https://forums.pixeltailgames.com/t/regarding-forum-moderation-leaderboard-ban-report/53402)

## 5. Appeal Process Loophole
Here’s the second flaw they won’t acknowledge:  
They _can’t_ delete a banned player’s old score.

That score the one that triggered the original ban is still stored in the database. <br>The only fix they’ve come up with is a cheap patch job: They’ve set the system to auto-refresh and remove flagged players from the leaderboard every cycle.
And that’s why leaderboard ban appeals can never succeed.

Because if they lift the ban, your same score reappears, showing everyone the system never actually worked. 

They could rewrite the system to properly remove scores and allow **real appeals,** but that would risk breaking internal systems tied to achievements, stats, or milestones.
The entire process is a facade, dressed up to look like fairness, and with only **6 actively playing users with leaderboard bans** - it’s not worth fixing, nobody is ever going to find out about these loopholes unless one of the 6 talks.

PixelTail’s appeal process is nothing more than a PR stunt.
