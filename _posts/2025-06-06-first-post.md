# MacDGuy Caught Lying 
<span style="color:teal">AAAA</span>

## Origin
During the _Tower Unite 1.0.0.0_ Steam news post in **April**,
**NixEmotions** raised a concern about a Chinese player named **SuSu**, who cheated to the top of the **Trivia Score** leaderboard - a position that typically takes players **years** to reach. 
After she highlighted this, the developers **removed SuSu’s trivia score**, implying they also agreed it was illegitimate.  [(^)](https://steamcommunity.com/app/394690/eventcomments/604153951183464508?snr=1_2108_9__2107&ctp=8#c604153951183496049) 
It's believed that if a player is caught cheating a minigame such as Trivia, then the players score is wiped to ZERO and they are only banned from that activity.
><span style="color:teal">In actual fact, the player receives ***'flag64'*** , which is a global leaderboard ban that does not *wipe* your ban, but instead periodically hides you from the leaderboards in all minigames at set intervals.</span>

But this is not public information,
Nix returned 2 weeks later on PixelTails Official Forum to report additional minigames that SuSu has cheated. 
Nix believed if the trivia score was wiped due to suspected cheating, it's only reasonable that **all** of SuSu’s scores be **scrutinised**, if not removed entirely, to maintain the **integrity of the leaderboards** and respect the time and effort of legitimate players.

><span style="color:teal">This is exactly what happened. SuSu received a flag64 leaderboard ban in April which completely wiped them from every leaderboard on the game. </span> 

So why have they returned?
This time achieving rank **#3** in Bowlings **Total Score**, and **Perfect Games.**

In the same thread, without garnering any attention from the developers yet, NixEmotions continued their claim that SuSu is still cheating despite the original leaderboard ban, for they have once again returned to rank **#1 in Trivia** by gaining 34 million xp in less than 24 hours.
<span style="color:teal">(minor misjudgment) The players name and scores are periodically *hidden* across the board. Scores  are tied to Steams backend, PixelTail can't actually wipe your leaderboard scores.</span>

MacDGuy appeared, saying that he would look into it on Monday.
><span style="color:teal">During this time, automatic removal of SuSu has already been in action from when they were given the ban several weeks earlier, and they are no longer on the leaderboards.</span>

It's now **June 1st**, and GateTheCat now joined the conversation with another screenshot, showing that the person in question has yet again returned to rank **#1 in Trivia**.
At this point, there's no question that there's something wrong with the leaderboard ban system.
