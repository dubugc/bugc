## Leaderboard Bans
In **April**, during the _Tower Unite 1.0_ Steam news post<br>
**NixEmotions** raised a concern, a Chinese player named **SuSu** had cheated  their way to the top of the **Trivia score** leaderboard - a position that typically takes players **years** to reach. <br>
After she highlighted this, the devs **removed SuSu’s Trivia score**, implying they also agreed it was illegitimate.  [(^1)](https://steamcommunity.com/app/394690/eventcomments/604153951183464508?snr=1_2108_9__2107&ctp=8#c604153951183496049)

Weeks later, Nix reported on SuSu again, this time SuSu achieved rank **#3** in Bowlings **Total Score**, and **Perfect Games.** <br>
Nix believed if the Trivia score was wiped due to suspected cheating, it's only reasonable that **all** of SuSu’s scores be **scrutinised**, if not removed entirely, to maintain the **integrity of the leaderboards** and respect the time and effort of legitimate players.

Despite SuSu having been removed from the leaderboards numerous times now, Nix claims that they have once again appeared as rank 1 again. <br>
MacDGuy emerged from his cave, saying that he would look into it on Monday, and alas without any intervention due to the already implemented automatic removal, SuSu was taken down from the leaderboards for the 2nd known time.

It's now been **6 weeks** since the issue was first reported.<br>
GateTheCat joined the conversation showing a screenshot of SuSu yet again returning to rank **#1 in Trivia**. At this point, there's no question that **there's something wrong with the ban system**.

## I Was the First Flag64
Back in ~~2017~~ 2020, I received the first leaderboard ban. <br>
Since then, I've reappeared on the leaderboards **hundreds of times**. The system hasn't worked for years. [(^3)](https://web.archive.org/web/20250601003906/https://forums.pixeltailgames.com/t/1-0-0-0-suspicious-possibly-cheated-high-scores-by-a-specific-player-on-leaderboards-still-present-on-other-leaderboards/53241) And I proved it with **before-and-after** screenshots of reaching rank **#1 Laser Tag**, despite being banned myself.
It was undeniable proof that leaderboard bans were not working.

><span style="color:grey"> Flag64 is the worst flag you can receive on Tower Unite for this reason alone, because its PixelTails broken system that enables repeat appearances and inflates report counts, which then escalate into harsher bans like mutes, media restrictions, and server bans. </span>


## MacDGuy Deleted My Report
I posted my firsthand experience with the system's failure as a reply to the on-going thread. I explained how players with leaderboard bans were receiving **additional reports** - a pattern clearly visible in this very thread.  <br>
In my own case, I was falsely reported in **2024** for “hacking” my way onto the Laser Tag leaderboards **overnight**. PixelTail even referenced this in my 2024 ban appeal, stating that a large majority of reports against me are related to **exploits** - despite having this leaderboard ban 4 years earlier, reports are still being accounted for.<br>
The very loophole that allows banned players to reappear on the leaderboards is now being used as justification for further disciplinary action - simply because all reports are tied to your account, even when **no cheating** has occurred.

The devs didn't respond to it. <br>
Instead, **MacDGuy deleted my post** and locked Nix's thread, leaving behind a vague message implying everything was under control. But nothing changed. **SuSu was rank #1 again that same day.**

## Exploits Should Not Be Shared Publicly
I created my own thread asking *why* my post had been removed. [(^4)](https://web.archive.org/web/20250601074659/https://forums.pixeltailgames.com/t/moderation-impacting-mental-wellbeing/53401) <br>
Again, I laid out the facts and attached the screenshot as proof.  I offered to demonstrate the "bug "to MacDGuy in-game on how leaderboard bans currently fail to function.

He **edited my thread** instead. <br>
Deleting the attached proof, pretends I never reported the issue to the team originally, then **accused me of 'sharing exploits"**. [(^5)](https://web.archive.org/web/20250601092822/https://forums.pixeltailgames.com/t/moderation-impacting-mental-wellbeing/53401)

## The Damage Done
False accusations from a lead developer don’t just disappear.<br>
Mac framed me as - "someone trying to help others exploit bans". Assigning malicious intent where there was none, and then locked the thread to shut down any chance of defending myself.

To be clear: **I was not sharing exploits**.<br>
I was exposing a broken system - one that has been silently failing for 5 years, dating back to **before the Arcade even existed**, when everyone was still gambling in the Casino.

Whether the deletion was out of embarrassment or an attempt to bury the truth, it's clear PixelTail wanted this off the record. If word spread that leaderboard bans have never functioned correctly, it could force players to question the legitimacy of *other* bans too - which is a dangerous game for a dev team with a shaky moderation history.

What Mac didn't anticipate was this: **I archived everything**. <br>
When I brought the archived links to his attention, I was **banned from the forum for Harassment.** [(^6)](https://web.archive.org/web/20250601115047/https://forums.pixeltailgames.com/t/regarding-forum-moderation-leaderboard-ban-report/53402)
