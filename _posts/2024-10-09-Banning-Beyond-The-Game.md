## Private Ban List
It begins back when we started the **Tower Unite Bans** group. We made sure everything was above board. But along the way, discovered something wild:<br>
**PixelTail won’t hesitate to ban somebody who doesn’t even have the game in their library.**

---

Before publishing anything, **Chef Boyardee**, **[redacted]** and **myself** discussed emailing PixelTail. We'd encountered players who seemed to be using what we believed was a **moderator-only ban list** - they knew when, why, and hopw players were being muted or banned  *before the player even knew*.

PixelTail told us the data **was public**, not hidden behind private channels. So we took that at face value. If they're not stopping people from accessing this so-called “moderator list,” then there should be no issue with making it accessible to everyone.

## Public Ban List
Boyardee built a tool to make the raw data readable and automated. He launched a Steam group that updated the active bans for the public to see.<br>
And that’s when the cracks started to show.

The issue made itself known after the original holders of the ban list realised they weren't the only ones with access now. The ones who usually operate in locked Discord channels suddenly had to share space with other TU players seeing the same info.

Of course, they didn’t like having their power diluted.<br>
So, they tattled to MacDGuy.

Instead of reaching out to us, MacDGuy reported the list to Valve to have the group taken down. We managed to reinstate the group, under the condition that the contents of the threads were to be deleted, as they had been reported by someone as being a **hit list on Tower Unite players.** LOL

## Compliance

Then things got quiet.<br>
Months passed, the group was inactive.<br>
I went back to building condos. That’s what got me permanently condo banned. But I wasn’t alone. Others were hit too - including **Chef Boyardee**, banned for **Suspicious Activity**.

And here’s the twist.

> **He doesn't even _OWN_ Tower Unite.**

Boyardee was always just the dev behind the tool. Once the group was shut down, he moved on.<br>
We went our separate ways, and yet… he got banned.

He wasn’t _in_ the game.<br>
He wasn’t _playing_ the game.

>"This makes the unfair bans many of you experience actually within the game more apparent than ever, and if they’re extending bans beyond the game itself, it’s something we should all be concerned about." - Chef Boyardee. [(^1)](https://steamcommunity.com/groups/towerunitebans)
